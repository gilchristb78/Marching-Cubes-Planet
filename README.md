# Marching-Planets
Upgrading the Marching Cubes Reloaded Algorithm to create a spherical planet



## TODO:
### Planet Gen
- [ ] Interpolation between points
  - [X] As Is
  - [ ] Add ring of verteces around chunk so normals are correct -> (currently only 2 sides have extra vertices [+x and +y] not [-x and -y]) 
- [ ] Vertex Normals instead of face normals ~ maybe got it working a bit, gotta look into more and check with proper uv mapping
- [ ] UV mapping
- [ ] Noise for planet shape (distance to center equation)
- [ ] Biomes
- [ ] Volcanos / other natural features
- [ ] Minerals
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Grass
- [ ] towns / cities
- [ ] Moons
- [ ] Non-Earth
- [ ] Rings
- [ ] Sun
- [ ] Asteroid field

### Game Features
- [ ] Gravity around Planet
- [ ] Mining
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] Chests
- [ ] Foundations
- [ ] Miner (quarry)
- [ ] ConveyorBelt
- [ ] controllable npc (think minecolony)
- [ ] Buildable ship
- [ ] space travel
